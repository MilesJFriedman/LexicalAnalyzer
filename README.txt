Enclosed in this zip file is a c file which contains my lexical analyzer...

To run it, simply open up the c file entitled lexicalAnalyzer.c and run the code as you would any other c file. 
The output will be sent to three text files: cleanInput.txt, (which will contain the PL/0 input without any comments) lexemetable.txt, 
(which will contain a table of all lexemes and their corresponding token types found within the PL/0 code) and lexemelist.txt.
(which will contain the lexemes and token types in list form for the use of the futuer semantic analyzer code)
